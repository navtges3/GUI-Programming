  For this assignment I took the content that I created in Homework 2 and introduced
  bootstrap to the html programming. To improve my website I use a jumbotron for my
  name and email at the top. Then I used one row with three columns to seperate the
  main content so that it stays seperated even on smaller screens. To add a little
  something else I turned my unordered lists into list-groups to add a visual aspect
  to the lists. On the cs.uml.edu server some of my bootstrap and css customizations
  did not come through but the changes are visible on the github.io site.
